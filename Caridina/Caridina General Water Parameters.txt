*Disclaimer* 
Keep in mind, some subspecies of the Cardidina Shrimp like Bee's, from thailand, are more sensitive than the other alternatives (Crystal and Tiger)

Temperature 64-76F
	-17.78C - 24.44C
	-Generally Lower is better for breeding
PH 6-7.5
	-Even as low as 5.5 for some Bee's

TDS 100-150ppm 
	-Keep in mind that what is IN the water matters more than TDS
	-Salty Shrimp Bee Shrimp Mineral GH+ is a solid choice
	-There are liquid alernatives that can be easier to use, but they come at a higher price per use

GH 4-6dGH 
	-Calcium and Magnesium mainly.
	-This is crucial to spawning/raising fry because calcium is critical to the egg, bone and tissue development

KH 0-2dKH
	-KH is responsible for buffering the ph in your tank, meaning it will try to get ur ph to 7, if it is too low it will bring it up, and if it is too high it will bring it down.
	-We want low KH for shrimp tanks to keep that lower ph range that Caridinas like for breeding
