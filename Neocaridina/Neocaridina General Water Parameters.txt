Keep in mind that everybody's tap water is different and it is important to know what you're putting in your tank! This is why everyone reccomends R/O water so you can control all the minerals that go in, read more about it here.
Neocaridina are fairly hardy compared to Caridina's. 

Popular species of Neocaridina are
	-Yellow/Gold 
	-Blue Dream
	-Sunkist Orange
	-Green Jade

Age Span 
	-1.5-2.5 years
Size
	-1.25-2 inches


Temperature 65-84F
	-18C - 28.8C
	-Generally in the 70's is best for breeding

PH 6.5-8
	-Neocaridina's do best in harder water with a neutral or basic pH level.

TDS 200-300ppm 
	-Keep in mind that what is IN the water matters more than TDS

GH 4-8dGH 
	-Calcium and Magnesium mainly.
	-This is crucial to spawning/raising fry because calcium is critical to the egg, bone and tissue development

KH 3-15dKH
	-KH is responsible for buffering the ph in your tank, meaning it will try to get ur ph to 7, if it is too low it will bring it up, and if it is too high it will bring it down.
	-A Higher KH for Neocaridina is ideal as they thrive in basic pH levels.
